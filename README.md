# UI-PROBLEMS
I will provide the solution about UI problems
You must have seen radial menu in games like GTA V and in almost all modern games you will observe such menus, one of the good readon of using such menus is its
appearence on page, usually radial menu floats over the page so you don't have to pause the game and switch to menu and do whatever you want. I have tried to make such
menu in Javascript. Since this is version 0.1 so you will just see the top layer of this menu, but with the passage of time it will be updated and will make it looks like
real game menu.


THANK YOU
